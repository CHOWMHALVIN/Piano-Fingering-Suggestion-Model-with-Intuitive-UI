# AI-powered Piano Performance Evaluation and Learning System
This project aims to develop an AI-powered piano learning system that provides an interactive and personalized learning experience for users of all skill levels. The system leverages AI and machine learning techniques to offer real-time finger recommendations, performance evaluation, structured learning programs, and music recommendations [1].

Key Features:

Real-time Hand Gesture Analysis: AI-PPELS utilizes computer vision to analyze hand gestures during piano playing, providing real-time feedback on finger placement and technique [1].
Performance Evaluation: The system analyzes audio recordings of piano performances to evaluate aspects such as note accuracy, timing, dynamics, and overall musicality [2].
Structured Learning Program: AI-PPELS offers a structured learning program with progressive lessons and exercises tailored to the user's skill level and learning goals [3].
Music Recommendation System: The system recommends music pieces for practice based on the user's skill level and preferences, offering a curated library of diverse pieces [4].
Target Users:

Piano learners of all skill levels, from beginners to intermediate and advanced players.
Music educators and instructors seeking an interactive teaching aid and resource.
Project Deliverables:

Performance analysis module with detailed feedback and assessment metrics.
AI algorithms for hand gesture analysis and real-time finger recommendations.
Structured learning program module with progress tracking and gamification features.
Music recommendation system based on users' skill levels and preferences.
A fully functional AI-powered piano learning system with a user-friendly interface.
